Download binary from https://github.com/iebb/F1WebViewer-SelfHosted/releases, or build your own, or just `go run main.go`

You can also run this proxy in your server, and use http://[server-ip]:13331/ to watch it. That might be useful if your home country doesn't have F1TV.

### Extras:

Currently authentication and Reese84 Requests are routed through the public website as the solution might be immature.
